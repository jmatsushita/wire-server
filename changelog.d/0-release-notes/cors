The `nginz` chart now configures nginx to only allow cross-origin requests from
an epxlicit allow list of sub-domains. By default these are:

```yaml
nginz:
  nginx_conf:
    allowlisted_origins:
    - webapp
    - teams
    - accounts
```

If you changed the names of these services you have to adjust those names in the nginz config as well!
